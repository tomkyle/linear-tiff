DESCRIPTION:  Converts RAW files into linear TIFF files.
              These utilities are used:

              - dcraw:        RAW to TIFF conversion
              - ImageMagick:  B/W grayscaling, TIFF resizing, ZIP compression
              - GNU Parallel: Use all CPU cores for maximum speed.

USAGE:        Batch mode: Process all RAW files in current directory:
              $ lineartiff -a [OPTIONS]

              Process one or more RAW file(s):
              $ lineartiff [OPTIONS] FILE [other FILE(s)]

OPTIONS:
-a            Turn on  batch mode: All RAW files will be processed.
              GNU parallel is used to process as many images at the same time
              as CPU cores are available.

-d            Desaturate colors, recommended for B/W negatives.
              If omitted, the TIFF files remain color-profiled (sRGB).
              If set, dcraw's TIFF output is converted to 16-bit grayscale,
              with a linear gamma 1.0 ICC profile applied (Gray-elle-V4-g10.icc).
              Grayscaling saves up to 60% in file size.

-o path       Output directory. Defaults to current working dir.

-r pixel      Resize larger side to this pixel length, preserving aspect ratio.

-v            Turn on dcraw's verbous mode.
