DESCRIPTION:  Converts RAW files into linear 16bit TIFF files
              with linear gamma profile. These utilities are used:

              - dcraw:        RAW to TIFF conversion
              - ImageMagick:  B/W grayscaling, TIFF resizing, ZIP compression
              - GNU Parallel: Use all CPU cores for maximum speed.

USAGE:        Batch mode: Process all RAW files in current directory:
              $ linear-tiff -a [OPTIONS]
              $ linear-tiff --all [OPTIONS]

              Process one or more RAW file(s):
              $ linear-tiff [OPTIONS] FILE [other FILE(s)]

OPTIONS:
-a, --all     Turn on batch mode: All RAW files will be processed.
              GNU parallel is used to process as many images at the same time
              as CPU cores are available.

--debug       Turn on debugging mode, showing whats going on.

-c, --crop    Crop output, if input file's meta data carry crop information.
              So you can crop your Camera file with e.g. Adobe Camera Raw
              which will store the crop info in a XMP sidecar file.
              The output image will be cropped basing on this information.

-d, --desaturate
              Desaturate colors, which is recommended for B/W negatives.
              Converts dcraw's TIFF output to 16-bit grayscale,
              applying a linear gamma 1.0 ICC profile (Gray-elle-V4-g10.icc).
              Grayscaling saves up to 60% in file size.
              If omitted, the TIFF files remain color-profiled (sRGB).

-f, --flipflop direction
              Mirror the image vertically or horizontally.
              Possible values are:

              flip     - mirror upside-down
              flop     - mirror in the horizontal direction
                         This is the way to go when your negatives
                         have been digitalized on their emulsion (back) side.
              flipflop - ... guess!

-h, --help    Display this help text

-o, --output path
              Output directory. Defaults to current working dir.

--rating threshold
              Ignore images with lesser star rating than this threshold value.
              Typical values are:

              0    - Ignore rejected files (which have star rating of -1)
              1    - Process any starred file
              2..5 - Process images with at least n stars

-r, --resize pixel
              Resize larger side to this pixel length, preserving aspect ratio.

-v, --verbous Turn on dcraw's verbous mode.
